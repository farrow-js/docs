After creating a server in [Getting Started](./getting-started.mdx), Farrow also can do more complex thing with another APIs as a HTTP Server.

Farrow middleware is an improvement based on the traditional middleware. Only [`requestInfo` object](../guide/http-server/base/request.mdx) and `next` function are in parameters, Response info is represeted by return value, a object created by `Response` object in farrow.

```ts
http.use((requestInfo, next) => {
  return Response.text("Hello Farrow");
});
```

And the [`requestInfo` object](../guide/http-server/base/request.mdx) is not [Node.js http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage), but only contains the raw information extracted from [Node.js http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage).

So it can be used like this.

```ts
http.use(({ pathname }, next) => {
  return Response.text(`Hello Farrow with path: ${pathname}`);
});
```

As you saw, the response information is set by returning [`Response` object](../guide/http-server/base/response.mdx). In addition to set the response body with `text`, the `json`, `file`... alse can set the body with another format.

```ts
http.use(({ pathname }, next) => {
  return Response.json({
    message: "Hello Farrow",
    pathname,
  });
});
```

And the status and headers, cookies of response alse can be set with [`Response` object](../guide/http-server/base/response.mdx).

```ts

```

Farrow also has **Routing** system, In addition to add middleware by `http.use`, Farrow also support use `http.METHOD()` to constraint the service the particular endpoint by `METHOD` function, `path` of URL and [Schema of Content](../guide/schema/validation-type.mdx).

```ts
http
  // constraint to `post` method, `/addTodo` path and with body like { content: string }
  .post("/addTodo", { body: { content: String } })
  .use(({ body: { content } }) => {
    // ...

    return Response.json({
      code: 1,
      message: "success",
    });
  });
```

If you do not you to constraint the [method](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), `http.match` is the better choice.

```ts
http
  .match({ pathname: "/addTodo", body: { content: String } })
  .use(({ body: { content } }) => {
    // ...

    return Response.json({
      code: 1,
      message: "success",
    });
  });
```

Farrow has provided the [`Router`](/docs/tutorial/http-server#todo) to support grouping api handling.

```ts
import { Http, Router, Response } from "farrow-http";

const todo = Router();

todo.get("/list").use(/** */);
todo.post("/add").use(/** */);
todo.put("/clear").use(/** */);

const http = Http();

http.route("/todo").use(todo);
```

Using **Farrow** in other HTTP Server is very easy. In Express, you can add Farrow app by adapter.

```ts
const http = Http();

http
  .match({
    pathname: "/test",
  })
  .use((data) => {
    return Response.text(JSON.stringify(data));
  });

const app = express();

app.use("/farrow", adapter(http));
```

:::info
For now, Farrow has support Express, Koa. See more at [farrow-express](../api/pipeline/04-farrow-express.mdx), [farrow-koa](../api/pipeline/05-farrow-koa.mdx).
